# Trying out C & more, lower level stuff

- tomorrow, try to rewrite with pointers instead arrays, and show progress bar
- then try to rewrite into C++, Rust, Go, Haskell.. Just to know the differencies and which low level language you like the most

- Maybe sometime we can rewrite this to assembly
- Try to compile this to WebAssembly with any language, compare speed & size.
